Introduction
------------
This repository is intended to keep gnucap Arails development snapshots and releases.

Workflow
--------
1) make modifications which you want to have in gnucap-arails
2) provide test cases for those modifications
3) when new version of gnucap-main is issued - make merge

as a result - this repository will always contain latest gnucap-arails

commits, which will be made after merge with new gnucap-main will be named like "gnucap-2009-08-11-merged"
