Introduction
------------
This repository is intended to keep gnucap Arails development snapshots and releases.

Workflow
--------
1) make modifications which you want to have in gnucap-arails
2) provide test cases for those modifications
3) when new version of gnucap-main is issued - make merge

as a result - this repository will always contain latest gnucap-arails

commits, which will be made after merge with new gnucap-main will be named like "gnucap-2009-08-11-merged"

Notes
-----
This repository shall be isolated from others and shall be kept as close as possible to Al's repository.
Any additional files (like specific build scripts, test cases) better keep in another repository 
(at least so far). 

Reason for that - good to have commits, which refer to changes in sources only and not overcrowd change 
log with irrelevant code.
