* test b6 - model with rsh, l, w;  element with resistance; bmm_semi_hsp

.param rval=10 rsheet=10 wi=2 le=4

R1  1 0 rmodel rval 
.model rmodel r rsh=rsheet w=wi l=le
* expected that rval will not be parsed and finally
* r=10 * 4 /2 = 20, so I=1/20 = 0.05
v1  1 0 dc 1

* r=10; i=0.1

.print op  v(r1) I(v1) 
.op 

.end


* to handle such constructions "r1 1 0 rmodel rval" w/o quotes need to change parser completely
* new parser has to separate syntactical and semantical processing
* during firts pass - it shall just read resistor "R1" with nodes "1 0" and with additional parameters "rmodel rval"
* during second pass (or rather - traversing the parsed tree) - traverser has to check:
* - if model with name "rmodel" is present - so use that mode
* - if not - may be .param rmodel =xxx is set - then use parameter
* - same with rval - if rval is param - ok - use it
* - may be that is name of parameter to pass inside the model - like R or DTEMP or alike
* such two-sate processing much more powerful comparing to one-stage
